            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            <p> Hi, I'm Jenny! I'm an international student from the US studying Physics and Computer Science. I'm especially interested in quantum computing. I love classical music and have been playing the viola for 11 years! 
                At UofT, I am in the Skule Orchestra and 2 string quartets: Iron Strings and the Vivo String Quartet. I am also a peer mentor for the Computer Science Second Year Learning Community! I have worked in retail for a few years 
            at Forever 21 and Anthropologie and have coached young musicians at Chamber Music Central.</p>
